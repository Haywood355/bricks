# Bricks Contributing Guide

Bricks is composed of a number of components, each in a separate directory. Each directory contains a `README.md` file that explains what the code does, and how to set up for development.

If you have any question, feel free to reach out on our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/brickscommunity/shared_invite/zt-1pb2hy3h2-9rDYWMZdHKxHblzUG0CpTQ)!
